Overall Avengers Endgame was a remarkable movie and a worthy culmination of the MCU up to this point .
There were some genuinely heartbreaking moments and breathtaking action sequences .
But to be honest , some of the movies I had to sit through to get here were not worth it .
Some of the early MCU movies and series leading up to this finale I found rather bland , unfunny and
sometimes just downright bad . But THIS MOVIE was one of the best movies I have seen in a while !
