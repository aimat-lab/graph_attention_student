"""
This is the base implementation of an experiment which uses a pytorch-based model to train on 
a visual graph dataset. The experiment trains the model for multiple REPETITIONS and reports 
on the evaluation results for the main prediction performance (regression or classification).

The evaluation of this experiment will create plot artifacts for the most important prediction
performance evaluation such as the regression plot (MAE, MSE, R2 metric) for regression tasks 
and a confusion matrix / AUC plot for classification tasks.
Additionally, this method will visualize some example graphs and provide some debugging 
information about the individual node embeddings.

The analysis of this experiment will load the index_data_map of the dataset and all the saved 
model instances from the disk and store them temporarily into the experiment storage so that 
they are accessible for sub-experimenet analyses.

#       contains all the elements of a visual graph dataset. Alternatively this string can be 
#       a valid unique identifier of a visual graph dataset which can be downloaded from the main 
#       remote file share location.
VISUAL_GRAPH_DATASET: str = 'rb_dual_motifs'
# :param DATASET_TYPE:
#       This string has to determine the type of the dataset in regards to the target values.

TEST_INDICES_PATH: t.Optional[str] = None
# :param NUM_TEST:
#       This integer number defines how many elements of the dataset are supposed to be sampled

#       if a test_indices file path is given.
NUM_TEST: int = 1000
# :param USE_BOOTSTRAPPING:
#       This flag determines whether to use bootstrapping with the training elements of the dataset.
#       If enabled, the training samples will be subsampled with the possibility of duplicates. This 
#       method can introduce diversity in the input data distribution between different trained models
#       even though they have the same train-test split.

#       predictions.

# :param TARGET_NAMES:
#       This dictionary structure can be used to define the human readable names for the various 
#       target values that are part of the dataset. The keys of this dict have to be integer indices 
#       of the targets in the order as they appear in the dataset. The values are string which will be

#       this list represents one layer, where the integer value determines the number of hidden units 
#       in that layer of the prediction network.
#       Note that the last value of this list determines the output shape of the entire network and 
#       therefore has to match the number of target values given in the dataset.
FINAL_UNITS: t.List[int] = [32, 1]

# == TRAINING PARAMETERS ==
# These parameters configure the training process itself, such as how many epochs to train 
# for and the batch size of the training

# :param EPOCHS:
#       The integer number of epochs to train the dataset for. Each epoch means that the model is trained 
#       once on the entire training dataset.
EPOCHS: int = 100
# :param BATCH_SIZE:
#       The batch size to use while training. This is the number of elements from the dataset that are

#       descent optimization.
BATCH_SIZE: int = 32
# :param LEARNING_RATE:
#       This float determines the learning rate of the optimizer.

# The following parameters configure the overall behavior of the experiment. This includes 
# meta parameters such as the number of repetitions to repeat the training process to obtain 
# a statistical measure of the model performance.

#       The number of independent times that the training of the model is repeated to obtain a statistical 
#       measure of it's performance.
