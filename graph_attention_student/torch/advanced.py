"""Advanced utilities for MEGAN model analysis and reporting.

This module provides high-level utilities for generating comprehensive prediction reports
and visualizing explanations from MEGAN (Multi-Explanation Graph Attention Network) models.
It includes functionality for creating PDF reports with predictions, model statistics, and
explanation visualizations, as well as various strategies for visualizing graph explanations.

The main functions in this module are:
- `megan_prediction_report`: Generates a complete PDF report for a single prediction
- `explain_value`: Creates visualizations for explaining model predictions on string inputs
- `explain_graph`: Creates visualizations for explaining model predictions on graph dictionaries
- `explain_graph_joint`: Visualizes all explanation channels in a single plot with different colors
- `explain_graph_split`: Visualizes explanation channels in separate subplots

    This function creates a detailed PDF report that includes the model's prediction,
    explanation visualizations, fidelity analysis, and model statistics. The report
    is generated from an HTML template and styled with CSS, then converted to PDF
    using weasyprint.

    The function processes a domain-specific string representation (e.g., SMILES for
    molecules) through the provided processing pipeline, makes a prediction using the
    MEGAN model, generates explanation visualizations, and compiles everything into
    a professional PDF report.

    :param value: Domain-specific string representation of the graph (e.g., SMILES
        string for molecular graphs). This will be processed into a graph structure
        using the provided processing instance.
    :param model: The trained MEGAN model instance used for making predictions and
        generating explanations. The model should be in evaluation mode.
    :param processing: Processing instance that converts the string representation
        to a graph dictionary and creates visualizations. Must be the same processing
        instance used during model training.
    :param figsize: Size of the explanation visualization figure as (width, height)
        tuple in inches. Default is (10, 10).
    :param output_path: Path where the PDF report will be saved. If a directory is
        provided, the report will be saved as 'megan_report.pdf' in that directory.
        If a file path is provided, it will be used as the exact output path.
    :param color_maps: List of matplotlib colormaps to use for visualizing different
        explanation channels. Should match the number of channels in the model.
    :param vis_width: Width in pixels for the graph visualization image. Default 1000.
    :param vis_height: Height in pixels for the graph visualization image. Default 1000.
    :param unit: Optional unit string to display with the prediction value (e.g., 'mg/L',
        'eV'). If None, no unit will be shown.

    :returns: The rendered HTML content as a string. The PDF report is saved to the
        specified output_path.

    :raises: Various exceptions may be raised during processing, model inference,
        visualization creation, or PDF generation. These should be handled by the caller.

    The generated report includes:
    - Prediction value and confidence metrics
    - Model architecture and performance statistics
    - Explanation visualizations showing node and edge importance
    - Fidelity analysis using leave-one-out deviations
    - Statistical summaries of explanation channels

    Given a graph dict representation ``graph``, an absolute ``image_path`` to the graph's visualization
    and a Megan ``model``, this function performs a forward pass of the given graph to obtain the
    node and edge importance explanations, which are then subsequently plotted on top of the graph's
    visualization.
    This function in particular will visualize all the explanation channels of the model as separate
    subplots of the same figure.
    The function returns a tuple of the figure object, a list of the individual axes objects and
    the info dict that was returned by the model's forward pass.

    Explanations are visualized in the "background" style, where the node importances are visualized
    as colored circles behind the graph nodes and the edge importances are visualized as colored lines
    behind the graph edges. The opacity/color of these elements is controlled by the actual importance
    value.

    :param graph: The graph dict representation of the graph to be explained. In particular, besides the
        usual node and edge features, this graph dict has to contain the ``node_positions`` key which
        contains the 2D pixel positions of the nodes in the graph visualization image.
    :param image_path: The absolute path to the image that visualizes the given ``graph``.
    :param model: The Megan model instance that is used to explain the given graph.
    :param fig_size: The size of the figure in inches.
    :param radius: The radius of the node importance circles.
    :param thickness: The thickness of the edge importance lines.
    :param color: The color of the node importance circles and edge importance lines.

    :returns: A tuple (fig, axs, info)
        - fig: The figure object that contains the visualized explanations.
        - axs: A list of the individual axes objects that contain the visualized explanations.
