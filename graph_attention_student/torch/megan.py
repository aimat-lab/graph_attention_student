    **SHAPE DOCUMENTATION**
    
    In the context of this class, the following abbreviations are used:
    
    - B: The number of graphs in one batche
    - V: The number of nodes in a graph
    - E: The number of edges in a graph
    - N_l: The dimensionality of the node feature vector after layer l
    - D: The dimensionality of the graph embedding of a single channel
    - M: The dimensionality of the edge feature vector
    - K: The number of importance channels
    
    :param node_dim: the integer number of features of the input node features vectors
    :param edge_dim: the integer number of features of the input edge feature vectors
    :param units: A list of integers, where each entry defines one layer in the attention-based graph
        encoder part of the network. The integer number defines the number of hidden units.
    :param importance_mode: A string identifier which defines what kind of task to be solved w.r.t 
        the model's explanation masks.
    :param importance_factor: A float factor that is multiplied with the explanation co-training loss
    :param num_channels: The integer number of explanation channels. For a regression task this has 
        to be ==2, for a classification task this has to equal to the number of possible classes.
    :param importance_units: A list of integers, where each entry defines one layer in the dense network 
        that predicts the node attention mask from the node embedding vector. The integer number 
        defines the number of hidden units.
    :param importance_offset: A float integer that influences the behavior of the explanation co-training
        procedure. In an approximative sense, this parameter influences how much of the graph will be 
        covered by the explanations. Lower values tend to produce more focused explanations, while higher 
        values may result in more expansive explanations.
    :param projection_units: A list of integers, where each entry defines one layer in the dense 
        networks that project the graph embedding into the graph projection. The integer number 
        defines the number of hidden units. The last integer in this list will determine the 
        dimensionality of the graph embeddings for each channel. Every explanation channel, will 
        have it's own projection network.
    :param sparsity_factor: A float factor that is multiplied with the sparsity regularization loss.
        The higher this factor the more the explanations will be promoted to be sparse (less nodes 
        being highlighted as important)
    :param final_units: A list of integers, where each entry defines one layer in the final prediction 
        MLP of the network. Each integer entry defines the hidden layers size of the corresponding layer.
        The last value in this list determines the output shape of the entire network and therefore has 
        to match the number of target values in the dataset.
    :param prediction_mode: A string identifier that determines what kind of task the network should 
        be used for - regression or classification. This determines the loss function that will be used 
        for the training of the prediction output.
    :param use_bias: A boolean flag of whether to use bias terms in the networks.
    :param learning_rate: A float value which determines the learning rate during the gradient descent 
        optimization of the network.

        This method implements the calculation of the SimCLR method for the explanation 
        representation learning objective.
        Given the input ``data`` representation, this method will return the corresponding loss value.
        
        The general idea behind SimCLR is to learn a semantic representation of the input elements in an 
        unsupervised fashion by jointly maximizing the similarity between an element and it's positive 
        samples (==semantically similar elements) and maximizing the similarity between an element and 
        its negative sampels (==semantically dissimilar elements). The main challange with this approach 
        being to obtain suitable positive and negative samples without supervised knowledge.
        
        In this specific case, the subject of the representatation learning will be each individual 
        explanation channel's explanation. 
        For the negative samples, we follow the common framework 
        of simply declaring all other samples in a given batch as the negative samples, since the 
        probability of them being semantically dissimiliar is higher than them being similar for a 
        moderatbly high number of expected distinct explanations.
        For the positive samples we apply a data augmentation where all non-explained nodes are 
        masked during the model prediction, therefore promoting the model to find a semantic 
        representation of the explained nodes only.

        masked from the prediction by setting all the attention values to zero. These modified forward results
