class AbstractGraphModel(pl.LightningModule):
    """
    This is the abstract base class for implementing a graph property prediction model.
    
    **PREDICT GRAPHS**
    
    This abstract base class implements the method "predict_graphs" which is a convenience wrapper around the 
    function of the model. The method simply receives a list of B graphs in the GraphDict format and returns 
    a numpy array with the shape (B, O) where O is the number of model outputs, that assigns the models predictions 
    to each of the given input graphs in the same order.

    This function is implemented agnostic of the actual network implementation - so long as that implementation 
    conforms to the interface of the "forward" function that is defined by this abstract base class and which will
    be explained in the next section.
    
    **ARBITRARY FORWARD RETURNS**
    
    This abstract base class enforces a certain interface for the forward, which dictates that the forward method 
    receives a pytorch_geometric ``Data`` instance as input and returns a *dictionary* object. The keys of this 
    dictionary should be some string identifier and the values are supposed to be torch tensor objects that are the 
    result of the models forward pass. The one entry that this dict HAS TO contain is "graph_output" which is supposed 
    to be the (B * V, O). The entry with this key will be necessary to compute the main prediction loss.
    
    In addition to that, the returned dict may contain arbitrary additional tensors that may want to be returned as 
    side results of the prediction process, such as the intermediate graph embedding representations or explanation 
    masks.
    
    When adding additional tensors to be returned as part of the dictionary, the following naming scheme has to be used:
    - starting with the prefix "graph" for tensors of the shape (B, ...)
    - starting with the prefix "node" for tensors of the shape (B * V, ...)
    - starting with the prefix "edge" for tensors of the shape (B * E, ...)
    
    The class also implements the method "forward_graphs" which is a convenience method that can be used to obtain the 
    various model outputs for a set of graphs given as a list of GraphDict instances. The method takes a list of graph 
    dicts as an input and returns a list of corresponding output dicts. Each output dict will contain numpy arrays 
    for that particular graph with all attributes that conform to the previously described naming scheme!
    
    B - batch dimensions, number of graphs
    V - number of nodes
    E - number of edges
    O - output dimension, number of outputs that the network generates for each graph
